NOTE : This algorihhm is specifically for the continuous feature values

Import Data
  o Used Iris dataset from the UCI ML Repository
Split data into training and testing
  o First 75% of data instances are on the training side.
  o Rest 25% are testing.
Calculate the Distance of the test set from all the training sets.
  o Calculate the distance using Euclidean distance
Calculate the K nearest neighbors
  o Sort the distance in ascending order and pick the top k neighbors.
Predict the class of the test based on the k neighbors
  o Use odd value for k
  o The Class of the test set is the one in which majority of the neighbors belong.
Calculate Accuracy by comparing all the prediction of the test set by the actual values.
